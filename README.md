Have you ever tried to have a stroll through Google Maps Street View, only to leave frustrated by the slow user experience and the disorienting incremental zooming effect?

This app aims to compile and present a meaningful collection of street view photos per discrete route interval given your desired origin and final destination points.

Enjoy
